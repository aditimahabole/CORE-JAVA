Let's understand the **Singleton Pattern** in Java step by step, in a **clear and structured way**.

---

## ✅ 1. What is the Singleton Pattern?

The Singleton Pattern ensures that **only one object (instance)** of a class is **ever created** during the program’s lifetime and **provides a global point of access** to that object.

---

## ✅ 2. Basic Singleton (Without Synchronization)

### Code:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;         // static instance of Singleton

    private Singleton() {                      // private constructor
        // prevents instantiation from outside
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {    // static method to return instance
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();        // creates instance if not already created
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### Why:

* **Private constructor:** Prevents creating object using `new Singleton()` from outside.
  ❗If not private, anyone can do `new Singleton()` and break Singleton rule.

* **Static instance:** Because we want the **same instance shared globally** across all calls.
  ❗If not static, each object will have its own copy → multiple instances.

* **Static method:** Allows us to call `getInstance()` without creating an object.
  ❗If not static, you'd need to create an object to call the method, which defeats the purpose.

## ❌ Problem: Multithreading Issue (Without Synchronization)

In multithreaded environment, **multiple threads can enter `getInstance()` simultaneously** when `instance == null`, and **create multiple objects**. This **breaks Singleton**.

### Example of Problem:

Thread A checks `if (instance == null)` → true
Thread B also checks `if (instance == null)` → true
Both create a new instance → ❌ **2 instances created**

---

## ✅ 3. Singleton with Synchronization (Thread-Safe but Slow)

To fix the above problem, we use **`synchronized` keyword** to make sure only **one thread at a time** can enter `getInstance()`.

### Code:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### Pros:

✔ Thread-safe – only one thread creates the instance

### Cons:

❌ Performance hit – every call to `getInstance()` is synchronized (even after instance is created)
– Slower in high-concurrency situations

---

## ✅ 4. Double-Checked Locking (Best of Both Worlds)

To avoid the performance cost of full synchronization, we use **Double-Checked Locking**.

### Code:

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {                          // 1st check (no locking)
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {                  // 2nd check (with locking)
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

### Why `volatile`?

* Ensures that the value of `instance` is **visible across threads** correctly (prevents caching issues).

### Pros:

✔ Thread-safe
✔ Fast – synchronization happens only once when instance is first created
✔ Efficient under high concurrency

## ✅ Summary

| Version                | Thread-Safe | Performance |
| ---------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Without Sync           | ❌           | ✅ Fast      |
| With `synchronized`    | ✅           | ❌ Slow      |
| Double-Checked Locking | ✅           | ✅ Fast      |
