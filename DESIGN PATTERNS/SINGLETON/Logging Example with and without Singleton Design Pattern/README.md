Let's simulate **multiple threads writing concurrently** to a log file — first **without** Singleton (which causes issues), and then **with** Singleton (which behaves correctly).

---

## ❌ Case 1: Without Singleton (Problematic Logging)

Each thread creates its own `Logger` instance → multiple file writers → unexpected behavior.

### `LoggerWithoutSingleton.java`

```java
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class LoggerWithoutSingleton {
    private FileWriter writer;

    public LoggerWithoutSingleton() {
        try {
            writer = new FileWriter("log.txt", true); // opens file in append mode
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public void log(String message) {
        try {
            writer.write(message + "\n");
            writer.flush();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### `Main.java`

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable task = () -> {
            LoggerWithoutSingleton logger = new LoggerWithoutSingleton();
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                logger.log(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " logs " + i);
            }
        };

        Thread t1 = new Thread(task, "T1");
        Thread t2 = new Thread(task, "T2");
        Thread t3 = new Thread(task, "T3");

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t3.start();
    }
}
```

### ⚠️ Issues

* File may get locked or partially written.
* Data could be lost or out of order.
* Multiple `FileWriter`s = resource overhead.

---

## ✅ Case 2: With Singleton (Safe Logging)

### `LoggerSingleton.java`

```java
import java.io.FileWriter;
import java.io.IOException;

public class LoggerSingleton {
    private static LoggerSingleton instance;
    private FileWriter writer;

    private LoggerSingleton() {
        try {
            writer = new FileWriter("log.txt", true);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }

    public static synchronized LoggerSingleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new LoggerSingleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }

    public synchronized void log(String message) {
        try {
            writer.write(message + "\n");
            writer.flush();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

### `Main.java`

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Runnable task = () -> {
            LoggerSingleton logger = LoggerSingleton.getInstance();
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                logger.log(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " logs " + i);
            }
        };

        Thread t1 = new Thread(task, "T1");
        Thread t2 = new Thread(task, "T2");
        Thread t3 = new Thread(task, "T3");

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t3.start();
    }
}
```


### ✅ Output

* Only **one FileWriter** is used.
* All threads **safely share** the logger.
* Clean, ordered log entries.

---



### ❓ Does "Multiple FileWriters" mean **many `log.txt` files**?

**No**, it usually **does NOT mean multiple log files** like `log1.txt`, `log2.txt`, etc.

---

### ✅ What "Multiple FileWriters" Really Means:

It means:

* **Multiple `FileWriter` objects** trying to write to **the *same* log file** (e.g., `log.txt`) **at the same time**.
* Each `FileWriter` opens its own **file stream**, which can cause:

  * 💥 **File lock conflicts**
  * 🔄 **Data corruption / partial writes**
  * 🚫 **Lost log entries**
  * 🌀 **Out-of-order logs**

---

### ❌ Problem Example Without Singleton:

If you do:

```java
Logger logger1 = new Logger();
Logger logger2 = new Logger();
```

Each logger might internally use its own `FileWriter`. Now both loggers write to `log.txt`, but:

* They **don't coordinate**
* One might write halfway and get interrupted by the other
* The log could end up **corrupt or inconsistent**

---

### ✅ Solution Using Singleton Pattern:

You ensure **only one instance** of `Logger`, which has **only one `FileWriter`**, shared by the entire application.

```java
Logger logger = Logger.getInstance();
logger.log("Some message");
```

✔ This ensures:

* Only one `FileWriter`
* One stream to the file
* Proper ordering and integrity of logs

---

### ✅ Summary:

| Term                 | Meaning                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Multiple FileWriters | Multiple instances writing to the same file (`log.txt`) |
| Multiple log files   | Different file names like `log1.txt`, `log2.txt`        |

In this case, "multiple FileWriters" **does NOT mean multiple log files** – it means **multiple streams to the same file**, which is dangerous.
