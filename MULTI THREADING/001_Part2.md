### Java Multithreading Key Points  

1. **Multithreading Implementation in Java**  
   - Java supports multithreading through the `java.lang.Thread` class and `java.lang.Runnable` interface.

2. **Multithreading in a Single-Core Environment**  
   - The JVM and OS manage multiple threads by switching between them.  
   - Time-slicing is used to allocate CPU time to threads, creating the illusion of concurrency.  
   - Example:  
     ```java
     class MyThread extends Thread {
         public void run() {
             for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                 System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is running");
             }
         }
     }
     public class Main {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
             MyThread t2 = new MyThread();
             t1.start();
             t2.start();
         }
     }
     ```
     *Output will vary as the OS schedules the threads differently each time.*

3. **Multithreading in a Multi-Core Environment**  
   - The JVM can distribute threads across multiple cores.  
   - This allows **true parallel execution** of threads, improving performance.  
   - Example:
     ```java
     class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
         public void run() {
             System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is running");
         }
     }
     public class MultiCoreExample {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             Thread t1 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
             Thread t2 = new Thread(new MyRunnable());
             t1.start();
             t2.start();
         }
     }
     ```
     *On a multi-core processor, threads may run truly parallel.*

4. **Main Thread in Java**  
   - When a Java program starts, the **main thread** begins execution.  
   - This thread is responsible for running the `main` method.  
   - Example:
     ```java
     public class MainThreadExample {
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             System.out.println("Main thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
         }
     }
     ```
     *Output: `Main thread: main`*
