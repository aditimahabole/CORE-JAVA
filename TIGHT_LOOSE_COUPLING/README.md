Instead of directly creating database objects like:

```java
UserDB udb = new UserDB();
OtherDB odb = new OtherDB();
```

We create an **interface** that defines common functions both databases should have.

Then, we make both `UserDB` and `OtherDB` **implement** that interface.  
This way, they follow the same structure.

Now, instead of using `UserDB` or `OtherDB` directly, we use a variable of the **interface type**, like:

```java
Database db = new UserDB(); // or new OtherDB();
```

We then **inject** this `db` object into `UserManager`.

So now, `UserManager` works with the interface, and it doesnâ€™t care which actual database it's using.  
It just calls the methods from the interface, and whichever database you gave it will handle the work.
