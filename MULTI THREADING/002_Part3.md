# Java Multithreading with Thread Class

## Overview
This example demonstrates multithreading in Java using the `Thread` class. A new thread is created by extending the `Thread` class and overriding the `run` method.

## Code Implementation

### **Main Class (`Test.java`)**
```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        World w = new World(); // Creating a new thread
        w.start(); // Starting the new thread
        
        // Main thread execution
        for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }
    }
}
```

### **Thread Class (`World.java`)**
```java
public class World extends Thread {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
            System.out.println("Thread 1");
        }
    }
}
```

## Explanation
1. **Creating a New Thread**
   - The `World` class extends `Thread` and overrides the `run` method.
   - The `run` method contains the code that the new thread will execute.

2. **Starting the Thread**
   - In `Test.java`, an instance of `World` is created and `start()` is called.
   - Calling `start()` invokes the `run()` method in a separate thread.

3. **Parallel Execution**
   - The `main` method runs a loop that prints the current thread's name.
   - Simultaneously, the `World` thread runs its own loop and prints "Thread 1".

## Expected Output (Sample)
```
Thread 1
Thread 1
Thread 1
main
main
main
...
```
(Note: The exact order may vary due to thread scheduling by the JVM.)

## Key Points
- The `Thread` class is extended to define a custom thread.
- The `run()` method contains the thread's logic.
- `start()` initiates a new thread.
- The main thread and the new thread run concurrently.
