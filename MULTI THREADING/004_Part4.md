# Java Multithreading with Runnable Interface

## Overview
This example demonstrates multithreading in Java using the `Runnable` interface. A new thread is created by implementing `Runnable` and passing an instance of it to a `Thread` object.

## Code Implementation

### **Main Class (`Test.java`)**
```java
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        World w = new World(); // Creating a Runnable instance
        Thread t1 = new Thread(w); // Creating a Thread object and passing Runnable instance
        t1.start(); // Starting the new thread
        
        // Main thread execution
        for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }
    }
}
```

### **Runnable Implementation (`World.java`)**
```java
public class World implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
            System.out.println("World");
        }
    }
}
```

## Explanation
1. **Creating a New Thread**
   - The `World` class implements `Runnable` and overrides the `run` method.
   - The `run` method contains the code that the new thread will execute.

2. **Starting the Thread**
   - An instance of `World` (which implements `Runnable`) is created.
   - A `Thread` object is created using `new Thread(w)`, where `w` is the instance of `World`.
   - `start()` is called on the `Thread` object to begin execution.

3. **Why Do We Need to Create a `Thread` Object?**
   - Unlike extending `Thread`, implementing `Runnable` does not make a class a thread by itself.
   - A separate `Thread` object is required to execute the `run()` method in a new thread.
   - This allows for better code organization and flexibility, as the same `Runnable` instance can be used with multiple threads if needed.

4. **Parallel Execution**
   - The `main` method runs a loop that prints the current thread's name.
   - Simultaneously, the `World` thread runs its own loop and prints "World".

## Expected Output (Sample)
```
World
World
World
main
main
main
...
```
(Note: The exact order may vary due to thread scheduling by the JVM.)

## Key Points
- The `Runnable` interface is implemented to define a custom thread.
- The `run()` method contains the thread's logic.
- A `Thread` object is created using `new Thread(Runnable instance)`.
- `start()` is called on the `Thread` object to begin execution.
- Using `Runnable` is preferred when a class needs to extend another class (since Java does not support multiple inheritance).
