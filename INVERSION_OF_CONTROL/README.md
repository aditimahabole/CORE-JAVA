Good question! Let's explain this properly so you can **answer clearly in an interview**.

# ðŸŽ¯ What is Inversion of Control (IoC)?
- **Normally**: Code controls how objects are created and how they interact.
- **With IoC**: The **control is inverted** â€” someone else (like a framework) **creates objects and manages their dependencies**.
  
âœ… This makes the code **more flexible**, **loosely coupled**, and **easier to test**.

---

# ðŸŽ¯ How can Inversion of Control be achieved?
Here are **main ways** to achieve IoC (you can mention these in your answer):

### 1. **Dependency Injection (DI)** âž” Most Common  
- Instead of creating dependencies manually, **they are injected** into the class (via constructor, setter, or method).
- Example: Spring Framework uses DI heavily.

```java
@Component
public class CarService {
    private final Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public CarService(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;  // Engine is injected, not created manually.
    }
}
```
**Interview Tip:**  
> "Dependency Injection is the most popular way to achieve IoC, where objects receive their dependencies from an external source instead of creating them."

---

### 2. **Service Locator Pattern**  
- Instead of creating services manually, code **asks a centralized registry** to give it the service.
- Not as clean as DI, but still better than manual wiring.

---

### 3. **Factory Pattern**  
- Object creation responsibility is given to a **factory class**.
- Code asks factory for an object instead of using `new`.

```java
Vehicle car = VehicleFactory.createVehicle("Car");
```

---

### 4. **Event-based Mechanism (Observer Pattern)**  
- Objects **react to events** without knowing who triggered them.
- Example: GUI frameworks, or Springâ€™s ApplicationEventPublisher.

---

# ðŸŽ¯ **Summary Line you can say in Interview:**
> "Inversion of Control is achieved mainly through Dependency Injection, where a framework like Spring takes responsibility for creating and injecting dependencies, making the application loosely coupled and easier to maintain."

# ðŸ”¥ Quick Chart for Memorizing:

| IoC Achieved By | Short Description |
|:---|:---|
| Dependency Injection | Framework injects dependencies into objects. |
| Service Locator | Central registry provides instances. |
| Factory Pattern | Factory class creates objects. |
| Event-based Communication | Objects interact by publishing and listening to events. |
