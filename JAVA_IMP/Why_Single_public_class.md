### **Why is there only one public class in a Java file?**  

In Java, a file can contain **multiple classes**, but **only one of them can be public**. This is because:  

1. **Java Compiler Restriction**:  
   - When a class is marked as `public`, it becomes **accessible from anywhere** (even outside the package).  
   - Java enforces **one public class per file** to maintain a **clear entry point** and prevent ambiguity in locating the class.  

2. **File Organization**:  
   - If multiple public classes were allowed, the compiler wouldn‚Äôt know which one to associate with the filename.  
   - This restriction keeps Java files **structured and easy to manage**.  

---

### **Why should the filename be the same as the class name?**  

1. **Java Compilation Rule**:  
   - When we compile a Java program, each class generates a separate **`.class` file** (bytecode).  
   - If a public class had a different name from the file, the compiler wouldn‚Äôt know which file to generate.  
   - **Example (incorrect usage):**  
     ```java
     // File name: MyFile.java
     public class AnotherClass { // ‚ùå Compiler Error: Class name does not match filename
         public static void main(String[] args) {
             System.out.println("Hello");
         }
     }
     ```
     **Compiler Error:** `AnotherClass is public, should be declared in a file named AnotherClass.java`  

2. **JVM Entry Point**:  
   - When running a Java program, JVM looks for a class that matches the filename.  
   - If the filename and public class name are different, JVM **won‚Äôt find the correct entry point**.  

3. **Code Readability and Maintainability**:  
   - Keeping the filename same as the class name makes code **organized and easy to understand**.  
   - It helps developers **quickly identify which file contains which class**.  

---

### **What happens if there is no public class?**  
- If no class is `public`, the filename **does not have to match** any class inside it.  
- Example:  
  ```java
  // File name: MyFile.java
  class AnotherClass {  // ‚úÖ No compiler error since there‚Äôs no public class
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello");
      }
  }
  ```
  **This will compile and run successfully!**  

---

### **Summary**  
| Rule | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Only **one public class** per file | Avoids ambiguity, helps Java compiler associate the filename with the class |
| **Filename = Public class name** | Ensures correct compilation and execution by JVM |
| **If no public class, filename doesn‚Äôt matter** | The class doesn‚Äôt have to match the filename |

This rule makes Java more **organized, easy to maintain, and avoids confusion** for both the compiler and developers. üòä

Yes! This code **will compile and run successfully**, even though `AnotherClass` is not `public`.  

### **How Will `main` Be Called?**  

1. **Compilation** (`javac MyFile.java`):  
   - The Java compiler will create a **bytecode file** for `AnotherClass`:  
     ```
     AnotherClass.class
     ```
   - Since there‚Äôs **no public class**, the filename (`MyFile.java`) **does not matter**.

2. **Execution** (`java AnotherClass`):  
   - When you run:  
     ```
     java AnotherClass
     ```
   - The JVM will **look for the `main` method** inside `AnotherClass` and execute it.  
   - The output will be:
     ```
     Hello
     ```

### **Do We Need to Create an Object?**  
‚ùå **No, we don‚Äôt need to create an object** of `AnotherClass` to run `main()`.  
‚úÖ This is because `main` is **`static`**, meaning it belongs to the class itself, not an instance of the class.

### **Where Would We Need an Object?**  
- If `main()` **was not static**, then we would need to create an object first:  
  ```java
  // File: MyFile.java
  class AnotherClass {
      public void main(String[] args) {  // ‚ùå Wrong! JVM looks for "public static void main"
          System.out.println("Hello");
      }
  }
  ```
  **Error:** `Main method not found in class AnotherClass`  
  - Here, since `main` is not `static`, we would have needed an object:
    ```java
    AnotherClass obj = new AnotherClass();
    obj.main(args);
    ```
  - But this won‚Äôt work because **JVM expects `public static void main(String[] args)`** to start execution.

### **Key Takeaways**
| Case | Runs? | Reason |
|------|------|--------|
| `public static void main(String[] args)` inside a **non-public class** | ‚úÖ Yes | JVM finds and runs `main` |
| `public void main(String[] args)` (without `static`) | ‚ùå No | JVM requires `static` to call `main` without an object |
| `main` inside a public class with filename mismatch | ‚ùå No | Compiler error due to public class filename mismatch |

üöÄ **Conclusion:** Even if the class is not `public`, as long as it has `public static void main(String[] args)`, **JVM will execute it** when we run `java AnotherClass`.


### **Why Do We Prefer Adding the `public` Keyword to a Class?**  

Yes, keeping a class **without any access specifier** (default access) allows us to have a **different filename and class name**. However, we **still prefer making the main class `public`** in most cases. Here's why:

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Code Organization & Readability**  
- By making a class **public**, we clearly indicate that this is the **main entry point** of the program.  
- It helps developers quickly locate the **starting point of execution** in large projects.  
- Example:  
  ```java
  public class MyApp {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
      }
  }
  ```
  - Here, any developer can instantly identify `MyApp` as the **main class** of the application.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Package-Level Accessibility Restriction**  
- If we **do not use `public`**, the class gets **package-private** access, meaning:  
  - It **cannot be accessed outside its package**.  
  - This can be a problem in larger projects where different packages need to interact.  
- Example:
  ```java
  class MyApp {  // No 'public' ‚Üí package-private
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
      }
  }
  ```
  - This class **cannot be accessed from another package**.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Enforcing the Filename-Class Name Rule**  
- Java **enforces** that a public class name **must match the filename**.  
- This makes sure that:
  1. Each Java file has a **clear identity**.  
  2. The class intended for execution is **easy to locate**.  

- Without `public`, you can name the file anything, but it **might cause confusion** in large projects.  
  - Example:
    ```java
    // File: MyFile.java
    class MyApp {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello");
        }
    }
    ```
    - Here, a developer might wonder why the **file is named differently** from the class.  
    - This **reduces clarity** when working in a team.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Standard Convention in Java Development**  
- Almost all Java projects follow the convention of keeping the **main class `public`** to make it **explicitly accessible and identifiable**.
- In industry-level projects, filenames **always match public class names** for:
  1. **Code consistency**  
  2. **Easy debugging and maintenance**  
  3. **Avoiding unnecessary confusion**  

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Interoperability with Frameworks & APIs**  
- Many Java frameworks (like **Spring, Hibernate**) and APIs **expect classes to be `public`**.  
- Example:
  ```java
  @SpringBootApplication
  public class Application {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          SpringApplication.run(Application.class, args);
      }
  }
  ```
  - Here, making `Application` **non-public** will **break Spring Boot‚Äôs execution**.

---

### **So Why Not Keep It Non-Public Always?**  
‚úÖ You **can** do that for small, single-file programs.  
‚ùå But in **real-world applications**, making the class public ensures:  
1. **Code clarity**  
2. **Correct accessibility**  
3. **Easier debugging & maintenance**  
4. **Standardized project structure**  

üöÄ **Conclusion:** We **prefer `public`** to ensure that our class is **explicitly accessible** and follows standard Java practices. While Java allows **package-private** classes, `public` is the best practice for better code management.
