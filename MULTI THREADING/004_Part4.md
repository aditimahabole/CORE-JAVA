# Java Thread Lifecycle Example

## Overview
This example demonstrates the different states of a thread in Java, including `NEW`, `RUNNABLE`, `TIMED_WAITING`, and `TERMINATED`.

## Code Implementation

### **Thread Lifecycle Example (`Test.java`)**
```java
public class Test extends Thread {
    
    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("RUNNING");
        try {
            // The thread goes into TIMED_WAITING state
            Thread.sleep(2000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            System.out.println(e);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Test t1 = new Test(); // Thread is created (NEW state)
        System.out.println(t1.getState()); // Prints: NEW
        
        t1.start(); // Thread starts execution (RUNNABLE state)
        System.out.println(t1.getState()); // Prints: RUNNABLE
        
        // Making the main thread sleep for 1 second
        Thread.sleep(1000);
        System.out.println(t1.getState()); // Prints: TIMED_WAITING (since t1 is sleeping)
        
        t1.join(); // Main thread waits for t1 to finish
        System.out.println(t1.getState()); // Prints: TERMINATED
    }
}
```

## Explanation
1. **NEW State**
   - When `t1` is created using `new Test()`, it is in the `NEW` state.
   - The thread has not started executing yet.

2. **RUNNABLE State**
   - When `t1.start()` is called, the thread moves to the `RUNNABLE` state.
   - It is now eligible for execution by the JVM scheduler.
   - **Java does not have a `RUNNING` state in the `Thread.State` enum.** Instead, `RUNNABLE` means the thread is ready to execute or is currently executing.

3. **RUNNING Phase (Conceptual)**
   - The `run()` method executes, printing `RUNNING`.
   - The thread then calls `Thread.sleep(2000)`, which puts it in a `TIMED_WAITING` state.

4. **TIMED_WAITING State**
   - `Thread.sleep(2000)` makes the thread pause for 2 seconds.
   - The `main` thread prints the state of `t1`, which is `TIMED_WAITING` after 1 second.

5. **TERMINATED State**
   - After `sleep(2000)`, `t1` completes execution and moves to the `TERMINATED` state.
   - `t1.join()` ensures that the main thread waits until `t1` has finished before continuing execution.

## Output Breakdown
```
NEW             // Initial state of the thread
RUNNABLE        // After calling start(), thread is ready to run
RUNNING         // The run() method starts execution (conceptual phase)
TIMED_WAITING   // After 1 sec, main thread prints state (since t1 is sleeping)
TERMINATED      // After 2 sec, t1 completes execution
```

## Important Note on `RUNNING` vs. `RUNNABLE`
- **Java's `Thread.State` enum does not have a `RUNNING` state.**
- `RUNNABLE` represents both threads that are ready to execute **and** threads that are currently executing.
- The JVM scheduler determines when a `RUNNABLE` thread actually runs on the CPU.

## What Does `join()` Do?
- `t1.join();` makes the **main thread wait until `t1` has finished execution**.
- Without `join()`, the main thread could potentially print `TERMINATED` **before** `t1` actually finishes.
- It ensures proper synchronization between threads.

## Summary
- `NEW`: Thread is created but not started.
- `RUNNABLE`: Thread is started and ready to run (or is already running).
- `TIMED_WAITING`: Thread is sleeping (paused for a specified duration).
- `TERMINATED`: Thread has finished execution.

## Output
    NEW
    RUNNABLE
    RUNNING
    TIMED_WAITING
    TERMINATED
